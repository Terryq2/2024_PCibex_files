The button will tell you whether you are going to be going to a comprehension question or if you will be going to a new trial.  The comprehension question will be a simple true or false statement about the passage you just read and will require you to click a button labeled true or false.  You will immediately be given feedback on your response before then being prompted with a button to begin the next trial.<br><br><br>",First we are going to complete a series of practice trials to get you familiar with the experiment.<br>,"That concludes the practice trials.
